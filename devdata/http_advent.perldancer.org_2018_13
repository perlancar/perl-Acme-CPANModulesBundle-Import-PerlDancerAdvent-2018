The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<p>Hello and goodbye, 2018! It seems like we hardly knew you. It's been a few 
years since our last calendar, and while everyone here is busy with other 
projects, we still wanted to give you a mini-advent-calendar this year. 
Welcome to the Twelve Days of Dancer!</p>
<p>This year's calendar features twelve posts that cover a wide range of topics.
We feature several new authors, cover some new ground (for us!) with an
article on accessibility, and even have a crossover post showing how Dancer
can be used with other frameworks.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let's dance!</p>
<h2><a name="state_of_the_dancer"></a>State of the Dancer</h2>

<p>In 2017 and 2018, we saw fewer but more significant updates to Dancer and 
Dancer2. With Dancer (1) being in maintenance mode, updates come only when
significant bugs are found, security vulnerabilities are found, or when a 
change is proposed that greatly improve the lives of Dancer developers. 
David Precious has been the light that guides Dancer(1) through the night,
and has been an excellent resource for both the Dancer and Dancer2 communities
on IRC and email.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dancer2 continues to grow and evolve, though at a less frantic rate
than earlier in its lifetime. Throughout the last two years, we've seen a 
growing list of contributions from our community, through documentation 
improvements, bug fixes, and new features.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, the Dancer Core Team ran a survey of Dancer developers to
get community input on the Dancer project. We received an excellent response 
to the survey, and it is being used to help guide the future direction of 
Dancer and its community. The results of this survey will be discussed in 
tomorrow's article.</p>
<h2><a name="new_features"></a>New Features</h2>

<p>Several significant new features came to pass since the last Advent Calendar:</p>
<h3><a name="websockets"></a>Websockets</h3>

<p>You asked, and Yanick delivered! <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Plugin::WebSocket">Dancer2::Plugin::Websocket</a>
enables websockets from within your Dancer2 applications. To make this work
properly, a non-blocking, streaming Plack server is needed (such as Twiggy).</p>
<h3><a name="mutable_serializer"></a>Mutable Serializer</h3>

<p>Dancer2 can now properly deserialize and serialize content based upon the 
request headers. Even better, it's completely and easily configurable! Thanks
to veryrusty for spearheading the effort to get this working!</p>
<h3><a name="no_default_middleware"></a>No Default Middleware</h3>

<p>To support ETags and other similar features, the default Plack middleware used
by Dancer2 can get in the way. To get around this, veryrusty added a 
<code>no_default_middleware</code> configuration option to Dancer2's <i>config.yml</i> file
to keep your application from using the default bundling of Plack middleware.</p>
<h2><a name="better_documentation"></a>Better Documentation</h2>

<p>Several dozen bug fixes, clarifications, and other enhancements have been made
to the documentation, primarily by the Dancer2 community. As a result, the 
quality of existing docs has been greatly improved.</p>
<p>Several new examples have been added to both the Dancer2 distribution as well
as the tutorial.</p>
<p>Sawyer has started a significant project to rebuild the Dancer2 documentation 
from scratch. The current docs lack a good description of why Dancer does 
things a certain way, and doesn't give new users a good grounding in web 
application design to know how and why some things should be done the way
we've recommended. The new doc project aims to address this by detailing 
important concepts in a clear and simple way.</p>
<h2><a name="performance_improvements"></a>Performance Improvements</h2>

<p>Several important performance improvements were made to Dancer2, the most
important of which being the migration from <code>MooX::Types</code> to <code>Type::Tiny</code>. 
When <code>Type::Tiny::XS</code> is used, the boost is even more significant.</p>
<h2><a name="security_improvements"></a>Security Improvements</h2>

<p>Two important security features were added:</p>
<p>The session engine now requires a <code>validate_id()</code> method to be implemented in
the various session engines. This requirement shuts down an attack vector by
making session IDs conform to a known format.</p>
<p>SysPete implemented a <code>change_session_id</code> keyword to easily change the 
current session ID. This is a common (and recommended) security practice,
especially when privilege level changes within an application.</p>
